# BarterPoint

BarterPoint is a minimum viable product (MVP) for a bartering app, designed to facilitate the exchange of goods between users. This project demonstrates my skills in developing a comprehensive application using React Native for the mobile UI, .NET for the web API, and SQL for database management.

## Features
- **React Native**: A dynamic and responsive mobile user interface.
- **.NET Web API**: Robust backend services to handle user requests and transactions.
- **SQL Databases**: Efficient data storage and retrieval to manage user data and bartering activities.
